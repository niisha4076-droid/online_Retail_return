# ONLINE RETAIL RETURN ANALYSIS

 ### Project Overview

* This project focuses on analyzing product return data from an online retail platform using Python and Pandas.

The main idea behind this project is to understand how often products are returned, identify the common reasons behind these returns, and present the findings in a clear and visual manner.
Product returns are a common challenge for online businesses. By analyzing return patterns, companies can improve product quality, delivery processes, and customer satisfaction. This project demonstrates how simple data analysis techniques can help extract meaningful insights from raw data.

### OBJECTIVES BEHIND THIS

The key objectives of this project are:
* To analyze online retail order data
* To identify returned products and their reasons
* To clean and preprocess the dataset using Pandas
* To visualize return reasons using bar plots
* To summarize findings that can help improve business decisions

### DATASET DESCRIPTION

The dataset used in this project is a CSV file containing information about online retail orders. Each row represents a single order.

The dataset includes the following columns:

* OrderID: Unique identifier for each order
* Product: Name of the product
* Category: Category to which the product belongs
* Returned: Indicates whether the product was returned (Yes or No)
* ReturnReason: Reason for returning the product, if applicable
The dataset file used is: online_retail_returns.csv

### TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Google Colab

### METHODLOGY

The project was completed by following these steps:
* Imported required Python libraries
* Loaded the dataset using Pandas
* Explored the dataset to understand its structure and contents
* Handled missing and inconsistent values
* Filtered the data to focus only on returned products
* Counted the frequency of different return reasons
* Visualized return reasons using bar charts
* summary statistics such as total orders and return percentage
* Interpreted the results to draw meaningful insights

### DATA VISUALIZATION

Bar plots were created to show how frequently each return reason occurs.
These visualizations make it easier to compare return reasons and understand which issues are most common among customers.

## KEY INSIGHTS
A significant number of products are returned due to issues such as 
* Damage 
* Wrong items, 
* Size mismatch

Certain product categories show higher return rates than others
Return data highlights areas where quality control and delivery processes can be improved
Analyzing return reasons can help reduce losses and improve customer experience

### CONCLUSION

This project shows how Pandas can be used effectively for real-world data analysis tasks. Even with a simple dataset, meaningful insights can be generated by cleaning, filtering, and visualizing data properly.
The analysis of return reasons can help online retailers identify problems early and take steps to reduce future returns.
Overall, this project helped strengthen practical skills in data handling, analysis, and visualization using Python.
